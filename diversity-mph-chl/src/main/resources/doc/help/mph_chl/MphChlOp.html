<p>
    The MERIS MPH Processor calculates chl-a concentrations by means of the <u><b>M</b></u>aximum <u><b>P</b></u>eak
    <u><b>H</b></u>eight and specific arithmetic expressions for different water types. Flags for floating material,
    eucaryote/cyanobacteria dominance and an adjacency effect indicator are provided for each pixel.
    <br> <br>
    The algorithm requires as input data bottom-of-Rayleigh corrected reflectances derived from MERIS spectral bands.
    A MERIS BRR product can be processed using the MERIS Bottom of Rayleigh Reflectance (BRR) processor available from
    VISAT -> PreProcessing,
    or the corresponding GPT processor. You may download it via the module manager if it is not included in your
    installation.
</p>

<p>
    Using the option to export intermediate MPH calculations allows the user to customize arithmetic expressions for
    calculating chl-a.
