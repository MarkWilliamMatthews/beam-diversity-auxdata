<p>
    The MPH Processor calculates chl-a concentrations by means of the <u><b>M</b></u>aximum <u><b>P</b></u>eak
    <u><b>H</b></u>eight
    and specific arithmetic expressions for different water types. Flags for floating material, eucaryote/cyanobacteria
    dominance and an adjacency effect indicator are provided for each pixel.
</p>

<p>
    Using the option to export intermediate MPH calculations allows the user to customize arithmetic expressions for
    chl-a calculation.
