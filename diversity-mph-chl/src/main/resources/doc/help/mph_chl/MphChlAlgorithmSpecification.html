<p>
    The Maximum Peak Height (MPH) algorithm exploits bottom-of-Rayleight reflectance peaks in certain spectral bands
    above
    a baseline, which passes through two other spectral bands (Matthews et al., 2012). This baseline technique is
    basically the same used in the Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) algorithms (Gower
    et al., 1999).
</p>

<p>
    Different reflectance peak positions occur mostly as a consequence of pigment concentration levels, and these peaks?
    heights depend on specific optical drivers (Figure 1).

<p>
    For the most common water types, MPH selects a suitable baseline
    using a sequence of predefined conditions and thresholds (Figure 2).
