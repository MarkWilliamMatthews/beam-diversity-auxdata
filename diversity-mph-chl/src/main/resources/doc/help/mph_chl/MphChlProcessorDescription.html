<h2>Processor user interface</h2>
<p>
    The MPH processor is invoked from the VISAT tool menu by selecting the MPH Processor command.
    On the command line the MPH processor is available by means of the Graph Processing Tool <i>gpt</i> which is located in
    the BEAM bin directory. Typing <i>gpt Diversity.MPH.CHL -h</i> displays further information.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the Diversity.MPH.CHL Processor command from the VISAT tool menu pops up the following dialog:

<h3>Source Product Group</h3>

<p><b>Source Product</b>: Here the user specifies the source product consisting of bottom-of-Rayleigh corrected
    reflectances. The combo box presents a list of all products open in VISAT.
    The user may select one of these or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product from the
    file system.
</p>

<h3>Target Product Group:</h3>

<p><b>Name</b>: Used to specify the name of the target product</p>

<p><b>Save as</b>: Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system.
    The combo box presents a list of available file formats. The text field or the button next to it allow to specify
    a target directory.
</p>

<p><b>Open in VISAT</b>: Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in VISAT. When the target
    product is not saved, it is opened in VISAT automatically.
</p>

<h3>Processing Parameters Panel</h3>

<p><b>Valid pixel expression</b>: An expression which identifies valid input pixels according to flags that are
    available in the input image.
</p>

<p><b>Cyano max value</b>: Threshold to cap maximum chlorophyll concentration estimated for cyanobacteria-dominant waters.</p>

<p><b>Chl thresh for float flag</b>: Value, above which cyanobacteria scum is expected, even if not indicated by a
    BRR maximum at 753 nm (see <a href="MphChlAlgorithmSpecification.html">Algorithm specification</a>, Figure 2).</p>

<p><b>Export mph</b>: Write the internally calculated MPH value to a separate band for the evaluation of custom peak
    height to concentration conversions.
